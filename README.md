# Bolt-Ebikes-Capstone
Single-page application retail site that sells ebikes.  
Created for an independent project course called "Capstone" at Regis University. 
As Java is the principal language taught at Regis, I created the back end in Java 
with few major challenges.  

I have sold bicycles online that I've modified with electric motors. 
I plan to potentially use my own site to sell electric bikes in the future. 
My primary challenge I foresee is legal liability.  The ebikes I've sold are 
faster than some municipalities allow on the road.
